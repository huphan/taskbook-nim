# taskbook-nim
Drop-in replacement for [Taskbook](https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook), written in Nim.

The code was more or less ported directly, and is *definitely* not idiomatic. 

Thanks to [Klaus Sinani](https://github.com/klaussinani) for creating Taskbook.

## Why?
**Speed** - This project runs more than an order of magnitude faster than the original version (almost entirely due to getting rid of Node).

## Installation
```
$ nimble install https://github.com/teschty/taskbook-nim
```
